    text: 'Everything has already been set up in <b>_Scene_AsteraX</b>, so you don''t
      need to edit the scene at all. Your job is to fill in the methods of the various
      scripts in the game.


      <b>Everything you need to change is in the <i>Scripts
      (Edit These!!)</i> folder.</b>


      I recommend approaching the scripts
      in the following order. <b>Start with #1 in PlayerShip</b>, and then follow
      the numbers. At the end of each method you complete, it will tell you if you
      need to move to another script.'
